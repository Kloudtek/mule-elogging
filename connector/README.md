# elogging Anypoint Connector

The object of mule-elogging is to provide a powerful logging framework for mule ESB in order to significantly facilitate
troubleshooting and identifying problems areas.

# Installation 
For beta connectors you can download the source code and build it with devkit to find it available on your local repository. Then you can add it to Studio

For released connectors you can download them from the update site in Anypoint Studio. 
Open Anypoint Studio, go to Help → Install New Software and select Anypoint Connectors Update Site where you’ll find all available connectors.

#Usage

All the useful information generated by mule-elogging is added to the logs using log4j's Thread context, so in order to
have that information in the logs, you will need to modify your log4j2.xml file to log those (we highly recommend using json logging)

# Reporting Issues
